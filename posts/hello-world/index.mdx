**Hello World**. This is my first test-post displaying all of the different elements that may show up in a blog post that I write.

I had a lot of fun designing this website / <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital garden</a>. There's a lot more I coulda woulda shoulda done with this site, but I had to put my perfectionism aside and just let it be as it is. I'll probably just make some little changes here and there as time persists.

I just needed a simple space for me to share thoughts and knowledge while I go continue to focus on honing my skillsets in front-end development and music production.

Be sure to <a href="https://tris.ck.page/join" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join my newsletter</a> if you'd like updates on when I release a new article! I'll most likely be writing about tech, front-end development, productivity, and who knows what else... I just want this to be an imperfect space to express myself :)

Blockquote:

> I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.

Example of an `inline code block`

```html
<!-- HTML code block: -->

<h1 class="title">Hello World</h1>
```

```css
/* CSS code block: */

body {
  margin: 0;
}

.title {
  color: skyblue;
}
```

```js
// JavaScript code block:

const name = 'Ellis';
console.log(name);
```

```jsx
// React code block with line & multiline highlighting:

// highlight-start
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class Profile extends Component {
  // highlight-end
  render() {
    return <div></div>; // highlight-line
  }
}
export default Profile;
```

```
Code and/or output block:
```

```js:title=example.js
Custom title code block fix this?
```

Diff code block:

```diff
+ {
+ import React, { Component } from "react"
+
+ class SomeClass extends Component {
-  render() {
-    return (<div></div>)
-   }
+ }
+ export default SomeClass
```

That's all for now!
